%       A %' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete con-
             version specification is %%'.

     The decimal point character is defined in the program's locale (category
     LC_NUMERIC).

     In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
     numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
     width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.


EXAMPLES
     To print a date and time in the form ``Sunday, July 3, 10:02'', where
     weekday and month are pointers to strings:

           #include <stdio.h>
           fprintf(stdout, "%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\n",
                   weekday, month, day, hour, min);

     To print pi to five decimal places:

           #include <math.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
           fprintf(stdout, "pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));

     To allocate a 128 byte string and print into it:

           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <stdarg.h>
           char *newfmt(const char *fmt, ...)
           {
                   char *p;
                   va_list ap;
                   if ((p = malloc(128)) == NULL)
                           return (NULL);
                   va_start(ap, fmt);
                   (void) vsnprintf(p, 128, fmt, ap);
                   va_end(ap);
                   return (p);
           }

ERRORS
     In addition to the errors documented for the write(2) system call, the
     printf() family of functions may fail if:

     [EILSEQ]           An invalid wide character code was encountered.

     [ENOMEM]           Insufficient storage space is available.

BUGS
     The printf family of functions do not correctly handle multibyte charac-
     ters in the format argument.
